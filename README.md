## Other projects

### Application Engine

[Netgrif Application Engine](https://github.com/netgrif/application-engine) is workflow management system powered by low-code language Petriflow written in Java.
Application Engine can run as a standalone java application, as a docker image, or you can embed it to your Java/Spring Boot project.

### Application Builder

For creating processes in Petriflow language try our free Application Builder on [https://builder.netgrif.com](https://builder.netgrif.com).
You can start from scratch or import existing process in BPMN 2.0 and builder automatically converts it into Petriflow.

### NCLI (Coming soon)

If you need help with setting up project or looking for tool to automate your developer work with NAE based applications,
take a look on [NCLI (Netgrif Command Line Interface)](https://github.com/netgrif/ncli).
